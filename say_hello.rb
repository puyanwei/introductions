Gentle Gregory Fish
A Short Story
by InadequateMonkey
Gregory Fish had always loved damp Upper Boggington with its joyous, jealous jungle. It was a place where he felt delighted.

He was a gentle, sinister, brandy drinker with curvy lips and fat fingers. His friends saw him as an aggressive, angry animal. Once, he had even helped a tasty baby flamingo cross the road. That's the sort of man he was.

Gregory walked over to the window and reflected on his hilly surroundings. The sleet rained like partying mice.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Ocean Blackman. Ocean was a wild queen with slimy lips and brunette fingers.

Gregory gulped. He was not prepared for Ocean.

As Gregory stepped outside and Ocean came closer, he could see the open smile on her face.

Ocean gazed with the affection of 2611 bold magnificent maggots. She said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want revenge."

Gregory looked back, even more sparkly and still fingering the tiny kettle. "Ocean, Is that real leather," he replied.

They looked at each other with irritable feelings, like two frightened, fierce foxes talking at a very violent wedding, which had trance music playing in the background and two adorable uncles laughing to the beat.

Gregory regarded Ocean's slimy lips and brunette fingers. "I feel the same way!" revealed Gregory with a delighted grin.

Ocean looked calm, her emotions blushing like a good, great guillotine.

Then Ocean came inside for a nice glass of brandy.

THE END"
